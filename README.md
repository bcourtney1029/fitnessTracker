## Installation 
You will need to npm init to get all the required node modules. If you are running the code locally the local host is set to port 3001. Server.js is the file that will start the application.

## Challenges
I really enjoyed working on this assignment, but I faced some challenges throughout the process. My biggest challenge was on getting the application to connect to my database. I continually received error messages when attempting to run the application, and I used the information provided in the error logs, along with Google/Youtube Fu, to alleviate my mistakes and help the application run. Front end work has always come easier to me, so this assignment was a great challenge for me to work on my back-end coding.
